# Vendetta




Vendetta is a first-person horror game built in Unreal Engine 5 where you step into the shoes of a police officer who has made a life-altering decision: to free prisoners from captivity. Now, you find yourself hunted by a dangerous mafia, and your survival skills are put to the ultimate test. The game will challenge you to navigate a dark and oppressive environment, where every decision can mean the difference between life and death.
## Current Features

- Basic Main Menu: The game features a fully functional main menu, allowing players to start a new game, adjust settings, and exit.

- Basic Sound Effects (SFX): Atmospheric sound effects have been integrated to enhance the horror experience, setting the mood and adding tension to the gameplay.

- Request System: A basic request system has been implemented, where players will encounter and need to solve various in-game requests or tasks, driving the narrative forward.
## Future Plans

As development progresses, the following features are planned to be added:

- AI for Enemies: The mafia and other enemies will have enhanced AI, making them more unpredictable and challenging to evade.
