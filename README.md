# Vendetta




Vendetta is a first-person horror game built in Unreal Engine 5 where you step into the shoes of a police officer who has made a life-altering decision: to free prisoners from captivity. Now, you find yourself hunted by a dangerous mafia, and your survival skills are put to the ultimate test. The game will challenge you to navigate a dark and oppressive environment, where every decision can mean the difference between life and death.
